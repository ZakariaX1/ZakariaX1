I'm a Software Engineer who's loved to work with programs and programming since a young age! When I was young I built the classic starter calculator in Batch and tried my hand at Python.\
Now I'm a Student who has worked with Full Stack Web development (though the backend is my favorite), OOP (Java my beloved) and have started a couple personal projects of my own or am helping others in theirs!\
Speaking of personal Projects, SSyncSpace (Coming Soon) is going to be my BIG personal project, it started out as a project to help out an online community but blew up in my head as a big idea for the future! Although progress is a little slow when you don't have much free time on hand, the progress that I've made has been fun and I hope that this project will be very usefull for those I intend to help with it. I've also worked with a close friend on his Discord Moderation and Community bot Sero and wish to port the GGoled rust application to Linux to make the most out of the hardware people have.

## Personal Projects
### 1. [SSyncSpace](https://github.com/ZakariaX1/SSyncSpace)
What started out as a project to help an online discord community to organize their thoughts for the events they host for their community, blew up into a grand idea in my head to expand it before I've even started. Unfortunately, because I'm a bit of a perfectionist I spent a lot of time looking for "the best" frameworks to use and have been worrying too much about the external design, so the project is very much still in it's infant stages where I might still even change what frameworks I'm using, but that's relatively normal for a personal project. The project will have "Spaces" that target different applications, platforms or ideas that then have their own tools. The first Space will be the initial project idea for the Discord Events, where event teams can get their event ideas in one place. (TODO: Explain this more, and don't forget to explain about the Discord Bot integration)
Currently we're making use of ReactJS (TypeScript) for the frontend, and the backend uses ExpressJS (TypeScript). I am also making use of PostgreSQL and Prisma, although I don't like the way Prisma handles so I might move to a different ORM. Lastly I like developing apps using docker containers, just to make sure dependencies stay consistent and so I can develop across my PC and laptop without worry.

Unfortunately, due to lack of time the progress has also been slowed further.

### 2. [MCRunner](https://github.com/ZakariaX1/mc_runner)
Closely related to SSyncSpace, this project is meant to serve as a community event plugin for MineCraft that the community can have fun with and should work together with a bot that has some kind of digital free currency or XP that the audience can use to help or hurt a player (or runner) on a server as the runner tries to complete the game. The audience members can get a reward if the runner wins and has helped the runner by getting a percentage of the prize pool, or a player can gain a big prize if their mob or item to hurt the player actually kills the runner.
The project has the minecraft plugin as well as a dummy discord bot, although the discord bot of Choice will likely be integrated with Sero (more about Sero further down)

Once more, due to lack of time and unfortunately also due to lack of interest of others, this project has been temporarily put on hold.

## Collaborated Projects
### 1. [Sero](https://github.com/Fluxpuck/sero)
A Discord moderation and community bot, more information is on the ReadME in the project, but what I've done for the project was help make a couple of the custom commands and associated API's to handle said commands. DiscordJS's documentation is very well made and I enjoy working on this project. 

Once again, the time constraints have lead me to put down the work on the project, that and most functionality has been handled already, but I would be happy to continue work on it.

### 2. [GGoled](https://github.com/JerwuQu/ggoled) (working on it soon)
A tool application made to control the OLED screen on the Steelseries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless base station, it can display images, given text and even the playing media using the application (currently only available on Windows). I've offered to port the application part to also work on Linux, as it'd be nice to have screensavers, pixel shift and now playing media available on Linux. Currently I'm working on figuring out Rust and how the Windows application could translate to a Linux application.
